Real-time Chat Application

Overview:
Build a real-time chat application where users can send messages and participate in group conversations.

Technologies:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL
WebSocket Protocol: Socket.IO or WebSocket API
Scalability Tools: Load balancer (e.g., Nginx), caching system (e.g., Redis)
Key Features:

User Registration: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

Group Chats: Users can create or join existing group chats with multiple participants.

Real-time Messaging: Implement a real-time messaging system where users can send and receive messages instantly.

Notifications: Notify users about new messages or mentions using web push notifications.

Scalability Measures: Design the application to handle increasing loads by implementing the following measures:

Load Balancing: Use a load balancer like Nginx to distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers.
Horizontal Scaling: Deploy multiple instances of the backend application to handle increased traffic. Configure load balancer to distribute traffic evenly.
Caching: Integrate a caching system like Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.
Database Optimization: Optimize database queries, create appropriate indexes, and use connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
Asynchronous Operations: Utilize asynchronous programming techniques to handle concurrent tasks and improve overall application responsiveness.
Monitoring and Scaling: Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) to track performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and scale resources as needed.
Additional Enhancements (Optional):

Message History: Allow users to view previous messages in a chat.
Message Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for secure messaging.
User Presence: Display online/offline status for users in the chat.
Media Sharing: Enable users to share images, files, or other media within chats.
